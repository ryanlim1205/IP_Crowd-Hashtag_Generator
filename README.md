# IP_Crowd-Hashtag_Generator
This repository is a copy of https://github.com/Rohbiar/IPCrowd which I worked as a NLP Team developer for Spring 2022 Intelligent Platform for Crowdsourcing Lab. Rohit's repository was created for this semester-long GT Influencer project, in which my team constructed the automated hashtag generation functionality.
