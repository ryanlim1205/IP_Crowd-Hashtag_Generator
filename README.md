# IP_Crowd-Hashtag_Generator
This repository is a copy of https://github.com/Rohbiar/IPCrowd which I worked as a NLP Team developer for Spring 2022 IP Crowdsourcing Lab. Rohit's repository was created for the End of Semester Presentation, in which my team prepared a demo for the automated hashtag generation - a functionality of the GT Influencer project.
